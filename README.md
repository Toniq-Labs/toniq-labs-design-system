# Dev

Make sure to run `npm install` first.

-   Run tests:
    ```
    npm test
    ```
-   View Storybook:
    ```
    npm run storybook
    ```
-   Build for publishing:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
-   Adding new dependencies:
    The peer dependencies between our deps are all messed up, so if installing a new package fails, try using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
